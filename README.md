# CI/CD Pipeline Project with GitHub Actions and Docker

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the complete implementation of a **Continuous Integration/```tinuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline** for a Node.js web application using **GitHub Actions** and **```ker**. The application runs on port 80 and is automatically built, tested, and deployed to DockerHub```enever code is pushed to the main branch.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Core Technologies
- **Node.js** (v18+) - JavaScript runtime for server-side development
- **Express.js** - Web framework for building the REST API
- **Docker** - Containerization platform for packaging the application
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD platform for automated workflows
- **DockerHub** - Container registry for storing Docker images

### Development Tools
- **Jest** - Testing framework for unit tests
- **ESLint** - Code linting and style checking
- **Supertest** - HTTP testing library
- **Git** - Version control system

### Cloud Platforms
- **GitHub** - Source code repository and CI/CD hosting```**DockerHub** - Container image registry
- **Ubuntu Server** - Development environment (AWS EC2)

## 🚀 What This Project Does

### Application Features
1. **Web Server**: Express.js server running on port 80
2. **REST API**: Simple endpoint that returns a welcome message with CI/CD information
3. **Health Monitoring**: Application logs and status information
4. **Containerization**: Fully dockerized for consistent deployment

### CI/CD Pipeline Features
1. **Automated Testing**: Runs unit tests on every code push
2. **Code Quality**: ESLint checks for code style and errors
3. **Docker Build**: Automatically builds Docker images
4. **Multi-Platform**: Supports both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures
5. **Deployment**: Pushes images to DockerHub registry
6. **Security**: Vulnerability scanning with Trivy
7. **Container Testing**: Verifies deployed containers work correctly

## 📋 Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Environment Setup
- Created project directory and initialized Git repository
- Set up Ubuntu server environment for development

### Step 2: Node.js Application Development
- Created Express.js server running on port 80
- Implemented REST API endpoint with CI/CD message
- Added proper error handling and logging

### Step 3: Testing Implementation
- Created unit tests using Jest and Supertest
- Implemented test coverage for all endpoints
- Added code quality checks with ESLint

### Step 4: Docker Configuration
- Created Dockerfile for containerization
- Optimized for production deployment
- Added .dockerignore for build optimization

### Step 5: CI/CD Pipeline Setup
- Created GitHub Actions workflow with 4 jobs:
  - Build and Test
  - Docker Build and Push
  - Container Testing
  - Security Scanning

### Step 6: Repository Configuration
- Connected to GitHub repository
- Set up proper branching strategy
- Added all necessary configuration files

### Step 7: Secrets Configuration
- Set up DockerHub credentials in GitHub Secrets
- Configured secure authentication for deployment

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Workflow

### Pipeline Stages
1. **Code Checkout** - Downloads source code
2. **Environment Setup** - Configures Node.js and Docker
3. **Dependency Installation** - Installs npm packages
4. **Testing** - Runs unit tests and linting
5. **Docker Build** - Creates container image
6. **Registry Push** - Uploads to DockerHub
7. **Deployment Testing** - Verifies container works
8. **Security Scanning** - Checks for vulnerabilities
